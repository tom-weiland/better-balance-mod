# About This Mod

This mod rebalances various Minecraft mechanics. Importantly, it can be used on servers *without* requiring players to also install it on their end! Plays best when used alongside [Better Repairing](https://github.com/tom-weiland/better-repairing-mod).

Below is a list of the changes it makes, along with some of the reasoning behind them.

## Changes to Villager Trading

### 1. Villagers no longer sell enchanted diamond gear.

Being able to get diamond tools and armor without ever going undergound to mine for the materials and without crafting it—in a game called MINE-CRAFT—is crazy! Weaponsmith, Toolsmith, and Armorer villagers will now trade enchanted iron tools and chainmail armor instead of diamond gear (except for the diamond hoe, you can still get that).

### 2. Librarians now trade less powerful books.

In Vanilla, a few trades is all it takes to get the most powerful enchantments on all your gear. This mod simply makes it so villagers no longer trade books with max-level enchantments—you can still get all the enchantments you need, but you'll have to do a bunch of combining to get them to the highest level.

Maybe now you'll actually still have a use for those high level enchanted books when you eventually find them out in the world.

## Other Changes

### 1. Iron golems cannot be lured by persistent mobs or pushed by water anymore.

If you kidnap villagers, lock them in a cage, and repeatedly terrorize them so that they summon an iron golem to protect them, and then you murder that iron golem, you can create an iron farm. This is incredibly overpowered, and in my experience having more iron than you know what to do with actually makes the game *less* fun. Out of iron? Put on a podcast and go caving like in the good old days!

Water streams are no longer able to push iron golems around, and iron golems won't target monsters that are persistent (they've been named or have picked up an item). This makes luring the golems to their death much more difficult (though not entirely impossible if you're really determined).


### 2. No more sleeping!

Ahhh, a fresh Minecraft world. First priority: punch wood, get some basic tools, and build a shelter to survive the dangers of the coming night! What's that? You could just kill 3 sheep (an animal that spawns virtually everywhere) instead, make a bed, and *never* worry about the night?

Being able to skip the night arguably robs Minecraft players of a core (extrinsic) incentive to build things: survival. Why fortify an area when you can easily, permanently, and without any tradeoffs, eliminate all threats before they even have a chance to show up just by right-clicking a bed every 10 minutes? This mod simply prevents you from sleeping, but you can still use beds to set your spawnpoint.
